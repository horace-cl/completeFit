# completeFit
Implementation of the complete fit PDF(theta, mass; params)

PDF = Y_s S(\theta)*efficiency(\theta) S(\mass) + Y_b B(\theta) B(\mass)

Where 
    Y_s and Y_b            -   are signal and background yields respectivelly
    B(\theta) and B(\mass) -   are the shapes of the bakground on the mass and angular variables
    S(\mass)               -   are the shapes of the signal on the mass and angular variables
    S(\theta)              -   is given by the theory
    efficiency(\theta)     -   is the efficiency on the angular variable
